<NODE id="4197" />For decades folks in <NODE id="4218" />Anniston<NODE id="4226" /> had known that all was not right in <NODE id="4263" />their<NODE id="4268" /> town.<NODE id="4274" /> <NODE id="4275" />Reverend Satcher<NODE id="4291" /> recalls the strange sights <NODE id="4319" />she<NODE id="4322" /> saw while growing up near the <NODE id="4353" />Monsanto<NODE id="4361" /> plant.<NODE id="4368" /> <NODE id="4369" />"One day the waters [of a nearby creek] would be purple, one day they would be red, another day yellow, then green," <NODE id="4486" />she<NODE id="4489" /> says.<NODE id="4495" /> <NODE id="4496" />"When <NODE id="4502" />we<NODE id="4504" /> were <NODE id="4510" />kids<NODE id="4514" /> we were walking in there barefooted."<NODE id="4552" /> <NODE id="4553" />And there was no mistaking it when the breeze blew the wrong way.<NODE id="4618" /> <NODE id="4619" />"Sometimes you couldn't go outside because of the smell," <NODE id="4677" />she<NODE id="4680" /> says.<NODE id="4686" /> <NODE id="4687" />"It was so horrible you couldn't stand it."<NODE id="4730" />

<NODE id="4732" />Except that <NODE id="4744" />they<NODE id="4748" /> did.<NODE id="4753" /> <NODE id="4754" />Mostly poor, <NODE id="4767" />the residents<NODE id="4780" /> didn't know what was being dumped into <NODE id="4820" />their<NODE id="4825" /> surroundings, much less the potential risks.<NODE id="4870" /> <NODE id="4871" />They<NODE id="4875" /> unknowingly continued to eat crops grown in the contaminated soil of <NODE id="4945" />their<NODE id="4950" /> back-yards.<NODE id="4962" /> <NODE id="4963" />The company, however, cannot claim such ignorance.<NODE id="5013" /> <NODE id="5014" />In <NODE id="5017" />1935<NODE id="5021" /> <NODE id="5022" />Monsanto<NODE id="5030" /> bought the <NODE id="5042" />Anniston<NODE id="5050" /> plant, which six years earlier had gotten into the business of manufacturing PCBs, short for polychlorinated biphenyls.<NODE id="5170" /> <NODE id="5171" />When first introduced, the man-made PCBs were rightly hailed as a boon to safety: Nearly impossible to set on fire, they were perfect for use as insulation in electrical equipment.<NODE id="5351" /> <NODE id="5352" />But their risks became apparent quickly enough.<NODE id="5399" /> <NODE id="5400" />It emerged at the trial that as far back as <NODE id="5444" />1938<NODE id="5448" />, <NODE id="5450" />Monsanto<NODE id="5458" /> had received a report from <NODE id="5486" />Dr. Cecil K. Drinkard<NODE id="5507" />, <NODE id="5509" />a professor of physiology at the <NODE id="5542" />Harvard School of Public Health<NODE id="5573" />, showing that PCBs were toxic to animals.<NODE id="5615" /> <NODE id="5616" />In <NODE id="5619" />1944<NODE id="5623" /> the company published safety guidelines for <NODE id="5668" />workers<NODE id="5675" /> who handled the chemicals<NODE id="5701" />.<NODE id="5702" /> <NODE id="5703" />For example, <NODE id="5716" />each employee exposed to PCBs<NODE id="5745" /> was to have two lockers on the job—one for work clothes, one for streetwear—to prevent contamination.<NODE id="5847" /> <NODE id="5848" />And <NODE id="5852" />employees<NODE id="5861" /> had to take a supervised shower after every shift.<NODE id="5912" /> <NODE id="5913" />Finally, in <NODE id="5925" />1979<NODE id="5929" /> the U.S. government banned the manufacture of the chemical on the grounds that it is a "probable" cancer-causing agent in humans.<NODE id="6059" />

<NODE id="6061" />Monsanto<NODE id="6069" /> had already stopped making PCBs at the <NODE id="6109" />Anniston<NODE id="6117" /> plant in <NODE id="6127" />1971<NODE id="6131" />.<NODE id="6132" /> <NODE id="6133" />But even in the years afterward, the company never told residents it had dumped its untreated wastes into streams and into two landfills.<NODE id="6270" /> <NODE id="6271" />At the trial <NODE id="6284" />Penn State<NODE id="6294" />'s <NODE id="6297" />Jack Matson<NODE id="6308" />, who had once worked for <NODE id="6334" />Monsanto<NODE id="6342" /> but who was now testifying as <NODE id="6373" />an expert witness for <NODE id="6395" />the plaintiffs<NODE id="6409" />, expressed amazement at the company's carelessness.<NODE id="6461" /> <NODE id="6462" />Back in <NODE id="6470" />1935<NODE id="6474" />, <NODE id="6476" />he<NODE id="6478" /> said, <NODE id="6485" />Monsanto<NODE id="6493" /> could have installed a simple filtration device called an oil-water separator that would have largely solved the problem for $3,000.<NODE id="6626" /> <NODE id="6627" />"<NODE id="6628" />They<NODE id="6632" /> were incredibly negligent in <NODE id="6662" />their<NODE id="6667" /> operation," says <NODE id="6685" />Matson<NODE id="6691" />.<NODE id="6692" />

<NODE id="6694" />It is unclear how much of the PCBs were released into the local environment.<NODE id="6770" /> <NODE id="6771" />In <NODE id="6774" />his<NODE id="6777" /> testimony <NODE id="6788" />Matson<NODE id="6794" /> estimated that 1.2 million lbs. were put into waterways and another 10 million lbs. into one of two landfills on nearby Cold Water Mountain.<NODE id="6935" /> <NODE id="6936" />How could this have happened?<NODE id="6965" /> <NODE id="6966" />"You're asking <NODE id="6981" />me<NODE id="6983" /> to comment on something over 30 years ago," says <NODE id="7033" />John Hunter<NODE id="7044" />, <NODE id="7046" />the chairman and CEO of <NODE id="7070" />Solutia Inc<NODE id="7081" />.<NODE id="7082" />, the <NODE id="7088" />Monsanto<NODE id="7096" /> spinoff that now runs the plant.<NODE id="7129" /> <NODE id="7130" />"<NODE id="7131" />I<NODE id="7132" />-can't speculate on what was going on there."<NODE id="7177" />

<NODE id="7179" />But to <NODE id="7186" />residents<NODE id="7195" /> the motives seem perfectly clear.<NODE id="7229" /> <NODE id="7230" />PCBs made <NODE id="7240" />Monsanto<NODE id="7248" /> an estimated $8 million in profit in <NODE id="7286" />1969<NODE id="7290" />.<NODE id="7291" /> <NODE id="7292" />In a town where the per capita income is $11,371, <NODE id="7342" />locals<NODE id="7348" /> believe <NODE id="7357" />Monsanto<NODE id="7365" /> was confident that it would never have to answer to anybody. "<NODE id="7428" />[<NODE id="7429" />They<NODE id="7433" /> thought,] '<NODE id="7445" />The suckers<NODE id="7456" /> will never find out,' " says <NODE id="7486" />Bettye Bowie<NODE id="7498" />. "<NODE id="7501" /> <NODE id="7502" />'Kill <NODE id="7508" />them<NODE id="7512" /> off.<NODE id="7517" /> <NODE id="7518" />Let <NODE id="7522" />them<NODE id="7526" /> inhale the fumes, eat the poisoned food.' "<NODE id="7570" /> <NODE id="7571" />That sort of cynicism is understandable, given some of the documents that came to light during the trial.<NODE id="7676" /> <NODE id="7677" />The minutes of a <NODE id="7694" />1969<NODE id="7698" /> company meeting cite a need to "permit continued sales and profits" and "protect [the] image of...[the] Corporation."<NODE id="7816" />

<NODE id="7818" />Despite evidence of pollution, the federal government and <NODE id="7876" />Alabama<NODE id="7883" /> state regulators seemed in no hurry to address the problem.<NODE id="7943" /> <NODE id="7944" />That began to change in <NODE id="7968" />1993<NODE id="7972" />, when <NODE id="7979" />a fisherman<NODE id="7990" /> reeled in a badly deformed largemouth bass from <NODE id="8039" />Choccolocco Creek<NODE id="8056" />; finally the issue became public.<NODE id="8090" /> <NODE id="8091" />When testing began, the results were unsettling.<NODE id="8139" /> <NODE id="8140" />For humans, the average normal level of PCBs in the blood is less than 2 parts per billion.<NODE id="8231" /> <NODE id="8232" />In a <NODE id="8237" />2000<NODE id="8241" /> survey of nearly 3,000 people in <NODE id="8275" />Anniston<NODE id="8283" />, more than a third were found to have greater than 10 ppb, and 41 registered more than 100 ppb.<NODE id="8379" /> <NODE id="8380" />"<NODE id="8381" />I<NODE id="8382" /> don't know of any places that have higher levels of <NODE id="8435" />PCB<NODE id="8438" /> contamination," says <NODE id="8460" />Dr. Howard Frumkin<NODE id="8478" />, of the <NODE id="8487" />Rollins School of Public Health<NODE id="8518" /> at <NODE id="8522" />Emory University<NODE id="8538" /> in <NODE id="8542" />Atlanta<NODE id="8549" />.<NODE id="8550" />

<NODE id="8552" />In its defense, <NODE id="8568" />Monsanto<NODE id="8576" /> tried to argue that PCBs pose very little if any demonstrable threat to humans.<NODE id="8656" /> <NODE id="8657" />Experts for <NODE id="8669" />the plaintiffs<NODE id="8683" /> pointed to at least 15 studies showing that PCBs can be linked to cancer.<NODE id="8757" /> <NODE id="8758" />Still, in contrast to cigarette smoke and asbestos, whose cancer-causing properties are well-established, it is true that the precise biological mechanism by which PCBs could make people sick has not been demonstrated—so far.<NODE id="8983" /> <NODE id="8984" />But as <NODE id="8991" />Emory<NODE id="8996" />'s <NODE id="8999" />Dr. Frumkin<NODE id="9010" /> points out, it would be unwise to assume the best.<NODE id="9061" /> <NODE id="9062" />"Absence of proof isn't proof of absence," <NODE id="9105" />he<NODE id="9107" /> says.<NODE id="9113" /> <NODE id="9114" />"It just means you don't have the proof yet."<NODE id="9159" />

<NODE id="9161" />On its own, <NODE id="9173" />Monsanto<NODE id="9181" /> has already set aside more than $180 million to clean up <NODE id="9239" />Anniston<NODE id="9247" />.<NODE id="9248" /> <NODE id="9249" />But residents believe that figure is far too low.<NODE id="9298" /> <NODE id="9299" />They<NODE id="9303" /> want the company to remove all the PCBs from the two landfills on Cold Water Mountain.<NODE id="9390" /> <NODE id="9391" />(The company maintains that the sites are perfectly safe, but the <NODE id="9457" />Environmental Protection Agency<NODE id="9488" /> says it is not certain whether PCBs are continuing to escape into the environment.<NODE id="9571" /> <NODE id="9572" />For reasons that are not clear, the level of PCBs in the air around <NODE id="9640" />Anniston<NODE id="9648" /> continues to be unexpectedly high.)<NODE id="9684" /> <NODE id="9685" />Despite the prospect of damage awards, <NODE id="9724" />some people<NODE id="9735" />, like <NODE id="9742" />Cassandra Roberts<NODE id="9759" />, 44, resent that <NODE id="9777" />their<NODE id="9782" /> neighborhoods will never be the same.<NODE id="9820" /> <NODE id="9821" />"It was a community that was poor, but it was a community," says <NODE id="9886" />Roberts<NODE id="9893" />, who still worships in <NODE id="9917" />Sweet Valley<NODE id="9929" /> but has moved away<NODE id="9948" />.<NODE id="9949" /> <NODE id="9950" />"It was home."<NODE id="9964" /> <NODE id="9965" />Yet <NODE id="9969" />many others<NODE id="9980" /> are determined to stay.<NODE id="10004" /> <NODE id="10005" />In one promising sign, <NODE id="10028" />Reverend Satcher<NODE id="10044" /> says <NODE id="10050" />she<NODE id="10053" /> will use <NODE id="10063" />her<NODE id="10066" /> share of any judgment against <NODE id="10097" />Monsanto<NODE id="10105" /> to build a church in town—hoping, perhaps, that even a little hallowed ground will help turn back the blight from below.<NODE id="10226" />
